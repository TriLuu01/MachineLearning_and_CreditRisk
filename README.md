# Machine_Learning_and_Credit_Risk

Perdict credit risk with Machine Learning Models in Python

##Project Background

 Having the option to anticipate acknowledge hazard for credit calculations by using machine learning can help banks and budgetary foundations better foresee inconsistencies, decrease chance cases, screen portfolios, and give proposals on what to do in case of fraud.

## Objectives
The goals of this challenge are to:

-Implement machine learning models.

-Use resampling to attempt to address class imbalance.

-Evaluate the performance of machine learning models.

## Resampling

Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as the number of good loans easily outnumber the number of risky loans. More preprocessing steps need to be considered (imbalanced-learn). Therefore, we need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. The following techniques have been used in this analysis to access the credit risk, using data from LendingClub; a peer-to-peer lending services company.
